# Week 8: Scientific Practice

This week's topic ties into your final projects well, so the first level ask you to preparae something like a project plan. This can even be your real one and we can give you feedback during the exercise session. Level 2 and 3 ask you to try out the testing concepts for yourself to see how they can fit into your workflow.

## Level 1: Design An Experimental Pipeline
Take a look at the project proposal. Now design a research question and experiment plan to explore it. Include all the details the proposal asks for and specify what sort of research you're talking about (exploratory or confirmatory). Make sure to include what evidence you expect to collect and qualify how sure you think you'll be about the answer. Upload a *partially filled out* version of the project proposal. 

## Level 2: Test for yourself
Generate what you feel is a reasonable amount of empirical evidence from the previous weeks (ideally related to your data sizes in level 1). Now research and apply an appropriate statistical test. Specify what it tests, why you can use it here and your null hypothesis. You may use any library you want to perform this test. What's the outcome? Reflect on the factor contributing to this result in a *.txt file*.

## Level 3: Power Analysis
Perform the power analysis form the lecture. How many seeds are predicted for different betas? Can you run them reasonably (you don't need to)? Repeat with subsamples of your seeds: what happens with fewer seeds of same distribution versus fewer seeds with extreme distributions? Upload a *.txt file* reflecting on your experiences with the test.
